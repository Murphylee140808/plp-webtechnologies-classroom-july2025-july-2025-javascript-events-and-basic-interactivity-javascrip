# Interactive Web Page with JavaScript Features

A comprehensive webpage showcasing JavaScript event handling, interactive elements, and form validation.

## Features

### 1. Event Handling Examples

* Click events for buttons and interactive elements
* Mouse events for FAQ section and dropdown
* Form submission events

### 2. Interactive Elements

* **Dark/Light Mode Toggle** : Changes the entire page theme with smooth transitions
* **Counter Game** : Increment, decrement, and reset a counter with visual feedback
* **Collapsible FAQ Section** : Expand and collapse answers to questions
* **Dropdown Menu** : Select options from a custom dropdown
* **Tabbed Interface** : Switch between different content tabs

### 3. Form Validation

* Name validation (minimum 2 characters)
* Email validation with regex pattern matching
* Strong password requirements (uppercase, lowercase, number, special character, 8+ characters)
* Password confirmation matching
* Real-time validation with user-friendly error messages

## How to Use

1. Simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser
2. Interact with the various elements:
   * Toggle between dark and light mode using the button in the top-right
   * Play with the counter game by incrementing, decrementing, or resetting the count
   * Click on FAQ questions to expand/collapse answers
   * Use the dropdown to select a programming language
   * Switch between tabs to view different content
   * Fill out the form to test validation (try submitting with invalid data to see error messages)

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5** : For page structure and form elements
* **CSS3** : For styling with custom properties, flexbox, grid, and responsive design
* **JavaScript** : For implementing all interactive features and form validation

## Code Structure

The project is contained in a single HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript:

* **HTML Structure** : Semantic HTML with a container, header, main content area with cards, and footer
* **CSS Styles** : Uses CSS custom properties for theming, responsive grid layout, and smooth transitions
* **JavaScript** : Organized into sections for each interactive component with detailed comments

## Browser Compatibility

This project works on all modern browsers including:

* Chrome (recommended)
* Firefox
* Safari
* Edge

# ðŸ§  Assignment: Interactive Web Pages with JavaScript

Welcome to the exciting world of interactivity! This assignment is all about **making your web pages feel alive**. Youâ€™ll learn how to respond to user actions, build engaging components, and validate form inputâ€”without reloading the page. This is where JavaScript gets fun, practical, and powerful. ðŸš€

---

## ðŸŽ‰ Part 1: JavaScript Event Handling and Interactive Elements

Letâ€™s start with the basics of **event handling**. You'll set up JavaScript to listen for user actions like clicks, mouseovers, keyboard input, and moreâ€”and respond to them in meaningful ways.

**Goal:** Use event listeners to react to user behavior and trigger changes on the page (e.g., showing messages, toggling classes, hiding/showing content).

---

## ðŸŽ® Part 2: Building Interactive Elements

Now itâ€™s time to apply what youâ€™ve learned by creating your own mini interactive features. You can build things like:

* A light/dark mode toggle
* A counter or button game
* A collapsible FAQ section
* A simple dropdown menu
* A tabbed interface

**Goal:** Use DOM manipulation + events to make the page dynamic and engaging. Be creative!

---

## ðŸ“‹âœ… Part 3: Form Validation with JavaScript

Forms are essential to the webâ€”and validating them properly is key to good user experience. Youâ€™ll build a form with multiple input fields (name, email, password, etc.) and write JavaScript to validate each field when the user submits or types.

**Goal:** Prevent incorrect form submissions by writing custom validation logic using conditions and regular expressions. Show user-friendly error messages and success feedback.

---

## Deliverables

* `index.html`: Your structured web page with at least one form and several interactive sections
* `script.js`: Your JavaScript file with:

  * Event handling for buttons, inputs, or links
  * At least 2 interactive features created from scratch
  * A fully functioning custom form validation (no HTML5-only validation)
* `style.css` (optional but encouraged): To style your interactive elements

Each section of your JavaScript should be commented to explain its purpose.

---

## Outcome

* Use of event listeners and appropriate event types
* Creativity and functionality of interactive elements
* Form validation accuracy and helpfulness of feedback
* Clear, modular, and well-commented JavaScript code
* A clean and functional user experience
